; NAME:
;   LOG_REBIN
;
; PURPOSE:
;   Logarithmically rebin a spectrum, while rigorously conserving the flux. 
;   Basically the photons in the spectrum are simply ridistributed according 
;   to a new grid of pixels, with non-uniform size in the spectral direction.
;
;   This routine makes the `standard' zero-order assumption that the spectrum
;   is *constant* within each pixels. It is possible to perform log-rebinning
;   by assuming the spectrum is represented by a piece-wise polynomial of
;   higer degree, while still obtaining a uniquely defined linear problem,
;   but this reduces to a deconvolution and amplifies noise.
;
;   This same routine can be used to compute approximate errors
;   of the log-rebinned spectrum. To do this type the command
;
;       LOG_REBIN, lamRange, err^2, err2New
;
;   and the desired errors will be given by SQRT(err2New).
;   NB: This rebinning of the error-spectrum is very *approximate* as 
;   it does not consider the correlation introduced by the rebinning!
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;   LOG_REBIN, lamRange, spec, specNew, logLam, $
;       OVERSAMPLE=oversample, VELSCALE=velScale, /FLUX
;
; INPUTS:
;   LAMRANGE: two elements vector containing the central wavelength
;       of the first and last pixels in the spectrum, which is assumed
;       to have constant wavelength scale! E.g. from the values in the
;       standard FITS keywords: LAMRANGE = CRVAL1 + [0,CDELT1*(NAXIS1-1)].
;       It must be LAMRANGE[0] < LAMRANGE[1].
;   SPEC: input spectrum.
;
; OUTPUTS:
;   SPECNEW: logarithmically rebinned spectrum.
;   LOGLAM: log(lambda) (*natural* logarithm: ALOG) of the central 
;       wavelength of each pixel. This is the log of the geometric 
;       mean of the borders of each pixel.
;
; KEYWORDS:
;   FLUX: Set this keyword to preserve total flux. In this case the 
;       log rebinning changes the pixels flux in proportion to their 
;       dLam so the following command will show large differences 
;       beween the spectral shape before and after LOG_REBIN:
;       
;           plot, exp(logLam), specNew  ; Plot log-rebinned spectrum
;           oplot, range(lamRange[0],lamRange[1],n_elements(spec)), spec
;           
;       By defaul, when this keyword is *not* set, the above two lines 
;       produce two spectra that almost perfectly overlap each other.
;   OVERSAMPLE: Oversampling can be done, not to loose spectral resolution, 
;       especally for extended wavelength ranges and to avoid aliasing.
;       Default: OVERSAMPLE=1 ==> Same number of output pixels as input.
;   VELSCALE: velocity scale in km/s per pixels. If this variable is
;       not defined, then it will contain in output the velocity scale.
;       If this variable is defined by the user it will be used
;       to set the output number of pixels and wavelength scale.
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;   V1.0: Using interpolation. Michele Cappellari, Leiden, 22 October 2001
;   V2.0: Analytic flux conservation. MC, Potsdam, 15 June 2003
;   V2.1: Allow a velocity scale to be specified by the user.
;       MC, Leiden, 2 August 2003
;   V2.2: Output the optional logarithmically spaced wavelength at the
;       geometric mean of the wavelength at the border of each pixel.
;       Thanks to Jesus Falcon-Barroso. MC, Leiden, 5 November 2003
;   V2.21: Verify that lamRange[0] < lamRange[1]. 
;       MC, Vicenza, 29 December 2004
;   V2.22: Modified the documentation after feedback from James Price.
;       MC, Oxford, 21 October 2010
;   V2.3: By default now preserve the shape of the spectrum, not the 
;       total flux. This seems what most users expect from the procedure.
;       Set the keyword /FLUX to preserve flux like in previous version.
